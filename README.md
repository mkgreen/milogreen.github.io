### [Diagnosis of breast cancer using a logistic classifier](https://github.com/mkgreen/Breast-Cancer-Classification)

[![breast-cancer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105948938/210696322-7f632410-13c6-4aab-8e00-bf7552a32917.jpeg)](https://github.com/mkgreen/Breast-Cancer-Classification)


**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** Identification of the type of Breast Cancer for quicker diagnosis. This assists professionals in the medical field to take appropiate measures to accurately diagnose, treat and save lives. 

**Quantifiable result:** Types of tumors were successfully classified with [**96%** accuracy by using K-means algorithm](https://github.com/mkgreen/Breast-Cancer-Classification/blob/main/Breast_cancer_classification_algorithm.ipynb).

- Used logistic regression to identify a tumour as malignant or benign based on various attributes
- Classified tumors as benign or malignant by studying patterns in measured attributes of those tumors
- Used Logistic regression classifier & optimized the accuracy by using the ROC curve
- Explored a machine learning approach to medical diagnosis

### [Amazon Fine Food Analysis using NLP](https://github.com/mkgreen/NLP-Amazon-Reviews/blob/main/README.md)

[![amazon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105948938/214133955-1eba5605-2603-404a-864a-707892271c7b.jpeg)](https://github.com/mkgreen/NLP-Amazon-Reviews/blob/main/README.md)


**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, TfidVectorizer

**Project Objective:** Given a review, determine whether the review is positive or negative based on Amazon foods .

**Quantifiable result:** A rating of 4 or 5 could be cosnidered a positive review. A review of 1 or 2 could be considered negative. A review of 3 is nuetral and ignored. This is an approximate way of determining the polarity (positivity/negativity) 

[**AUC** Score of 94%](https://github.com/mkgreen/NLP-Amazon-Reviews/blob/main/NLP_Project_Amazon_Reviews.ipynb) .
- Given a review, it is determined whether the review is positive or negative.
- Used NLP for this approach.
- A review of 1 or 2 could be considered negative. A review of 3 is nuetral and ignored.

### [Identifying symptoms of orthopedic patients as normal or abnormal](https://github.com/mkgreen/Orthopedic-Patients-Classification-KNN-NB)

[![knee-brace-ortho](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105948938/210697291-f37f4d78-f7f5-48e8-b7fd-4375a9254df3.png)](https://github.com/mkgreen/Orthopedic-Patients-Classification-KNN-NB)

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib,KNN,NB

**Project Objective:** In this project, the data provided multiple instances of orthopedic parameters and their classification as either Normal or Abnormal. I implemented K Nearest Neighbor to classify and diagnose the patients.

**Quantifiable result:** Successfully classified the orthopedic parameters as either Normal or Abnormal with an accuracy of **82%.**

- Used the K Nearest Neighbours algorithm to classify a patient's condition as normal or abnormal based on various orthopedic parameters
- Compared predictive performance by fitting a Naive Bayes model to the data
- Selected best model based on train and test performance

[![Mobile](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105948938/210698301-3cab65b9-c084-47a4-915f-a092d8377d9e.jpeg)](https://github.com/mkgreen/Fraud-Detection-DT-Ensemble/blob/main/Bagging_and_Boosting_Esemble_Project.ipynb)


**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib,XGboost Classifier, BaggingClassifier

**Project Objective:** Predict fraud by using the data gathered from features associated with clicks, such as IP address, operating system, device type, time of click, etc.

**Quantifiable result:** Successful classification of people who did and did not download the app after watching an advertisement with an accuracy of 97%.

- Used the XGboost Classifier algorithm to classify the Pepole who downloaded the app after watching the advertisement and identify the click fraud
- Compared predictive performance by fitting a BaggingClassifier model to the data
- Selected best model based on train and test performance

### [Prediction of user interest using bank data](https://github.com/mkgreen/Banking-Classification-Logistic-Regression/blob/main/Portugese%20Banking%20Classification.ipynb)

[![banking](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105948938/210697085-9f12b658-be7a-4493-afd1-10c9aaf397d5.jpeg)](https://github.com/mkgreen/Banking-Classification-Logistic-Regression/blob/main/Portugese%20Banking%20Classification.ipynb)


**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** Using the real-world data of a Portuguese banking institution, predict if a client will subscribe to a term deposit (variable y).

**Quantifiable result:**

- The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).

### [Examining the effect of environmental factors and weather on demand of Bike rentals](https://github.com/mkgreen/Bike-Rental-Demand/blob/main/Linear_Regression_Project_Seoul_Bike_Data.ipynb)

[![seoul-bikes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105948938/210696437-cb69d9ae-3f14-4792-a80c-0c6f938cac36.jpeg)](https://github.com/mkgreen/Bike-Rental-Demand/blob/main/Linear_Regression_Project_Seoul_Bike_Data.ipynb)


**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** Predicting Bike rental demand on basis of weather and seasonal factors in advance to take appropiate measures which finally will result in bike utilization.

**Quantifiable result:** Successfully able to predict the Bike rental demand resulting in [**94%** accuracy](https://github.com/mkgreen/Bike-Rental-Demand/blob/main/Linear_Regression_Project_Seoul_Bike_Data.ipynb).

- Used Random Forest Regressor to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
- Cross Validation for validating the training data and model fit.
- Fit a Random Forest Regressor with high prediction accuracy through iteration
